# calculator
This project: https://kristinana97.github.io/calculator, was focused on JavaScript. It works like an iPhone calculator(without +/- and percentage functionalities).
A bit about functionality: 
* Mathematical operations with integers and decimals
* All clear & Clear entry
* Calculating the result without using the calculate key
